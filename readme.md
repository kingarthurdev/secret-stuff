# Repo for scripts for that one competition (that can't be named or other teams will steal our scripts)
Download and unzip the appropriate files for your system, follow the readme in each of the zip files 

# Windows + server:
The lgpo.zip file is for windows, needed in combination with one of the other baselines/remediations scripts to work. 

Run the windowscp.bat and windowscp.ps1 as admin. If windowscp.ps1 can't be run due to scripts disabled, run this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
