#------------NOTE THIS-------------
	#Needs file created with valid users and valid admins called users.txt and admin.txt
	#DO NOT FORGET TO CREATE README WITH ALL USERS NAMES, ELSE IT WILL DELETE SOMEONE YOU DON'T WANT IT TO
	#if adding users, create addusers.txt

	#Look up /etc/services

#Also, DOES NOT DELETE THE FILE/COMMAND STARTING NETCAT BACKDOOR, just grabs the executable and moves it. Usually gives points, but should still try and pinpoint where it is coming from
#Remember, go into dash, type remote and select Desktop sharing. This should be off and may be on, but just not sure how to script it yet
#MAKE SURE NO BAD REPOSITORIES
